# Botle Coins Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview
The Botle Coins feature has been successfully implemented as a rewards/points system where **1 coin = ₹1**. This feature allows users to earn and accumulate coins for various activities like attending classes, achievements, and more.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Mobile App (Flutter) Changes

#### User Model (`lib/models/user.dart`)
- Added `botleCoins` field (int) with default value 0
- Updated `fromJson()` to parse `botle_coins` from API response
- Updated `toJson()` to include `botle_coins` when sending to server
- Handles both int and string values from API for robustness

#### Dashboard Widget (`lib/widgets/dashboard/botle_coins_widget.dart`)
✨ **New File Created**
- Beautiful animated widget displaying coins with gradient background
- Animated coin icon that rotates during initial display
- Counting-up animation when coins value changes
- Shows both coin count and equivalent rupee value
- Tappable with feedback message (ready for future rewards screen)
- Responsive design with shadows and visual effects

#### Dashboard Screen (`lib/screens/dashboard/dashboard_screen.dart`)
- Integrated `BottleCoinsWidget` at the top of dashboard
- Displays user's current coin balance
- Centrally positioned for prominence
- Shows for all user roles (students, coaches, admins)

#### Providers (`lib/core/providers.dart`)
- Updated `_saveUserData()` to store `botle_coins` in SharedPreferences
- Updated `_loadUserData()` to restore `botle_coins` from cache
- Ensures coins persist across app restarts

### 2. Server (Python/Flask) Changes

#### User Model (`app/models/user.py`)
- Added `botle_coins` field initialized to 0 in `__init__()`
- Updated `to_dict()` to include `botle_coins` in user dictionary
- Updated `from_dict()` to handle existing users without the field (defaults to 0)
- All new users automatically get 0 coins on creation

#### API Endpoints (`app/routes/mobile_api.py`)
- Updated `/auth/profile` GET endpoint to ensure `botle_coins` is always present
- Adds default value 0 for users without the field
- Also handles `botle_coins` for child profiles
- Backward compatible with existing users

### 3. Database Migration

#### Migration Script (`migrate_add_botle_coins.py`)
✨ **New File Created**
- Automated script to add `botle_coins: 0` to all existing users
- Safe migration with confirmation prompts
- Shows progress and verification
- Handles errors gracefully
- Can be run multiple times safely

## How to Use

### Running the Migration

To add botle_coins to all existing users in the database:

```bash
cd "adrilly web"
python migrate_add_botle_coins.py
```

The script will:
1. Connect to your MongoDB database
2. Count users without the field
3. Ask for confirmation
4. Update all users with `botle_coins: 0`
5. Verify the migration
6. Show sample of updated users

### Testing the Feature

1. **Mobile App Testing:**
   ```bash
   cd "adrilly mobile/coaching_app"
   flutter run
   ```
   - Login with any user account
   - Check the dashboard - you should see the Botle Coins widget
   - The widget will animate on first load
   - Tap the widget to see the info message

2. **API Testing:**
   - Call `/mobile-api/auth/profile` endpoint
   - Response should include `"botle_coins": 0` for all users

3. **Verify New Users:**
   - Create a new user through the app or web interface
   - Verify they automatically have `botle_coins: 0`

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. **Earning Coins:**
   - Attend classes: +10 coins per class
   - Perfect attendance: +50 coins bonus
   - Achievements: Variable coins
   - Referrals: +100 coins

2. **Rewards Screen:**
   - View coin history/transactions
   - Browse available rewards
   - Redeem coins for benefits
   - Track coin earnings over time

3. **Admin Features:**
   - Award coins manually to users
   - Create coin-based promotions
   - View coin distribution analytics
   - Set coin earning rules

4. **Notifications:**
   - Notify users when they earn coins
   - Alert when new rewards are available
   - Weekly coin summary

### API Endpoints to Add

```python
# Award coins to a user
POST /mobile-api/coins/award
{
  "user_id": "...",
  "amount": 10,
  "reason": "Class attendance",
  "class_id": "..."
}

# Get coin transaction history
GET /mobile-api/coins/history?user_id=...

# Redeem coins
POST /mobile-api/coins/redeem
{
  "user_id": "...",
  "amount": 100,
  "reward_id": "..."
}
```

## Database Schema

### User Collection
```json
{
  "_id": ObjectId("..."),
  "name": "John Doe",
  "phone": "1234567890",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "role": "student",
  "botle_coins": 0,  // New field
  "created_at": ISODate("..."),
  "updated_at": ISODate("...")
}
```

### Future: Coin Transactions Collection
```json
{
  "_id": ObjectId("..."),
  "user_id": ObjectId("..."),
  "amount": 10,
  "type": "earned",  // earned, redeemed, awarded
  "reason": "Class attendance",
  "reference_id": ObjectId("..."),  // class_id, reward_id, etc.
  "balance_after": 10,
  "created_at": ISODate("...")
}
```

## Technical Notes

### Coin Value
- 1 Botle Coin = ₹1 (Indian Rupee)
- Stored as integer (no decimal coins)
- Always non-negative (minimum 0)

### Security Considerations
- Coin updates should be server-side only
- Validate all coin transactions
- Log all coin changes for audit trail
- Prevent negative balances
- Rate limit coin earning to prevent abuse

### Performance
- Coins are cached in SharedPreferences for quick access
- Updated on every login/profile fetch
- Minimal database overhead (single integer field)

### Backward Compatibility
- Existing users get 0 coins by default
- API gracefully handles missing field
- Mobile app works with or without coins data
