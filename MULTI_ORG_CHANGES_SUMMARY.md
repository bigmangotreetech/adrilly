# Multi-Organization Support - Changes Summary

## Files Modified

### 1. `app/models/user.py`
**Changes Made:**
- ✅ Added `organization_ids` field (array of ObjectIds) to store multiple organizations

- ✅ Updated `get_accessible_organizations()` to return all organization IDs
- ✅ Updated `to_dict()` to include both `organization_id` and `organization_ids`
- ✅ Updated `from_dict()` to handle both old and new data structures

### 2. `app/routes/web.py`
**Changes Made:**

#### Login & Session Management
- ✅ Updated `verify_code()` login to store `organization_ids` in session
- ✅ Updated `legacy_login()` to store `organization_ids` in session
- ✅ Updated `login_required()` decorator to handle `organization_ids`

### 3. `app/routes/users.py`
**Changes Made:**

#### User Queries
- ✅ Updated `/api/users` GET endpoint to query by `organization_ids` (line 50, 58)
- ✅ Updated coach validation in group creation to check `organization_ids` (line 238)
- ✅ Updated `/api/users/organizations/stats` to use separate filters for users vs entities (line 490-493)

## New Files Created

### 1. `MULTI_ORGANIZATION_SUPPORT.md`
Comprehensive documentation explaining:
- Database schema changes
- Session management
- Query patterns
- Usage examples
- Migration path
- Testing checklist
- Future enhancements

### 2. `migrate_users_multi_org.py`
Migration script that:
- Adds `organization_ids` to all existing users
- Converts single `organization_id` to array format
- Includes verification functionality
- Includes rollback option
- Provides detailed progress reporting

## Key Concepts

### Data Structure

**Old Format (Single Organization):**
```json
{
  "_id": "user_id",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "organization_id": "org_id_1"
}
```

**New Format (Multiple Organizations):**
```json
{
  "_id": "user_id",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "organization_id": "org_id_1",  // Primary org (backward compatibility)
  "organization_ids": ["org_id_1", "org_id_2", "org_id_3"]  // All orgs
}
```

### Query Patterns

**User Queries (Multi-Org):**
```python
# Find users in an organization
query = {'organization_ids': ObjectId(org_id)}
users = mongo.db.users.find(query)
```

**Entity Queries (Single-Org):**
```python
# Find classes in an organization
query = {'organization_id': ObjectId(org_id)}
classes = mongo.db.classes.find(query)
```

### Session Management

**Session Data:**
```python
session = {
    'user_id': 'user_id',
    'organization_id': 'org_id_1',  // Active/current organization
    'organization_ids': ['org_id_1', 'org_id_2', 'org_id_3']  // All organizations
}
```

## Backward Compatibility

✅ **Existing users with only `organization_id` work seamlessly:**
- Login converts single `organization_id` to `organization_ids` array
- Queries work for both old and new data structures
- `organization_id` field maintained for compatibility

✅ **No breaking changes:**
- All existing functionality continues to work
- Old code that reads `organization_id` still works
- New code can use `organization_ids` for multi-org features

## Migration Steps

### 1. Backup Database
```bash
mongodump --db your_database --out backup/
```

### 2. Run Migration Script
```bash
cd "adrilly web"
python migrate_users_multi_org.py
```

### 3. Verify Migration
```bash
python migrate_users_multi_org.py --verify
```

### 4. Test Application
- Test user login
- Test user management
- Test organization filtering
- Test child profile creation
- Test payment access

### 5. If Issues Arise (Rollback)
```bash
python migrate_users_multi_org.py --rollback
```

## Testing Checklist

### Authentication
- [ ] Login with existing user (single org)
- [ ] Login with user (multiple orgs)
- [ ] Session contains correct organization data
- [ ] Login_required decorator works

### User Management
- [ ] View users list (filtered by org)
- [ ] Create new user
- [ ] Edit user
- [ ] Delete user
- [ ] Export users to CSV

### Child Profiles
- [ ] Create child profile
- [ ] Child inherits parent's organizations
- [ ] View child profiles
- [ ] Edit child profile
- [ ] Delete child profile

### Permissions
- [ ] Org admin can only see users in their org
- [ ] Coach can only see students in their org
- [ ] Super admin can see all users
- [ ] Payment access checks work

### API Endpoints
- [ ] GET /api/users (with org filter)
- [ ] POST /api/users/groups
- [ ] GET /api/users/organizations/stats
- [ ] POST /api/users/<user_id>/children

## Known Limitations

1. **Organization Switcher Not Implemented**: Users can belong to multiple orgs but can't switch between them in UI (yet)
2. **No Organization-Specific Roles**: User has same role in all organizations
3. **No Organization Invitations**: Users must be manually added to additional organizations

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Organization Switcher
Add UI to switch between organizations:
```python
@web_bp.route('/switch-organization/<org_id>')
@login_required
def switch_organization(org_id):
    # Implementation provided in MULTI_ORGANIZATION_SUPPORT.md
```

### 2. Organization-Specific Roles
Allow different roles in different organizations:
```json
{
  "organization_roles": {
    "org_id_1": "coach",
    "org_id_2": "student",
    "org_id_3": "org_admin"
  }
}
```

### 3. Organization Invitations
Allow users to be invited to join additional organizations:
```python
@web_bp.route('/api/organization/<org_id>/invite-user', methods=['POST'])
def invite_user_to_organization(org_id):
    # Send invitation
    # User accepts
    # Add organization to user's organization_ids
```

## Support & Questions

For questions or issues:
1. Check `MULTI_ORGANIZATION_SUPPORT.md` for detailed documentation
2. Review migration script output for errors
3. Verify database state with verification command
4. Check session data in browser dev tools

## Rollback Plan

If migration causes issues:

1. **Stop Application**
2. **Restore Database Backup**
   ```bash
   mongorestore --db your_database backup/your_database
   ```
3. **Or Run Rollback Script**
   ```bash
   python migrate_users_multi_org.py --rollback
   ```
4. **Revert Code Changes** (if needed)

## Success Criteria

✅ All existing users have `organization_ids` field  
✅ Login works for all users  
✅ User queries return correct results  
✅ Organization filtering works correctly  
✅ Child profiles inherit parent's organizations  
✅ Backward compatibility maintained  
✅ No breaking changes  
✅ All tests pass
